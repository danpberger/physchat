# PhysChat Icons

You'll need to create PNG icons in these sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

Suggested design: A magnifying glass with a physics atom symbol, using APS navy blue (#00274c).

For quick testing, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files renamed appropriately.
